## üéØ MIGRATION STRATEGIES

### Option 1: Grandfathering (Recommended)

**Description:** Existing users keep old pricing for a limited time.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Minimal churn risk
- ‚úÖ Positive user experience
- ‚úÖ Time to prove value
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå Delayed revenue increase
- ‚ùå Complex billing logic
- ‚ùå Two pricing tiers to maintain

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In subscription pricing logic
function getSubscriptionPrice(userId: string, planId: string): number {
  const user = await getUser(userId);
  const subscription = await getSubscription(userId);
  
  // Check if user is grandfathered
  const isGrandfathered = 
    user.createdAt < new Date('2025-01-08') && 
    subscription?.createdAt < new Date('2025-01-08');
  
  if (isGrandfathered) {
    // Use old pricing
    return OLD_PRICES[planId];
  } else {
    // Use new pricing
    return NEW_PRICES[planId];
  }
}
```

**Timeline:**
- **Jan 8, 2025:** Announce price change
- **Jan 15, 2025:** Deploy new pricing (grandfathering enabled)
- **Feb 1, 2025:** New users pay new prices
- **Aug 1, 2025:** All users migrate to new prices

**Duration:** 6 months grandfathering period

---

### Option 2: Immediate Migration

**Description:** All users switch to new pricing immediately.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate revenue increase
- ‚úÖ Simple billing logic
- ‚úÖ Single pricing tier

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå High churn risk
- ‚ùå Negative user experience
- ‚ùå Potential backlash

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Simple - just use new prices for everyone
function getSubscriptionPrice(planId: string): number {
  return NEW_PRICES[planId];
}
```

**Timeline:**
- **Jan 8, 2025:** Announce price change (30 days notice)
- **Feb 8, 2025:** All users migrate to new prices

**Mitigation:**
- Offer 1 month free to affected users
- Provide upgrade incentives
- Clear communication about value added

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Description:** Grandfathering for loyal users, immediate for new/recent users.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Reward loyalty
- ‚úÖ Faster revenue increase
- ‚úÖ Balanced approach

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå Complex logic
- ‚ùå Potential unfairness perception

**Implementation:**

```typescript
function getSubscriptionPrice(userId: string, planId: string): number {
  const user = await getUser(userId);
  const subscription = await getSubscription(userId);
  
  // Grandfather users who:
  // 1. Created account before Jan 1, 2025
  // 2. Have active subscription for >3 months
  const isLoyalUser = 
    user.createdAt < new Date('2025-01-01') &&
    subscription?.createdAt < new Date('2024-10-01');
  
  if (isLoyalUser) {
    return OLD_PRICES[planId]; // Grandfathered
  } else {
    return NEW_PRICES[planId]; // New pricing
  }
}
```

**Timeline:**
- **Jan 8, 2025:** Announce price change
- **Jan 15, 2025:** Deploy new pricing
- **Feb 1, 2025:** Recent users migrate to new prices
- **Aug 1, 2025:** Loyal users migrate to new prices
