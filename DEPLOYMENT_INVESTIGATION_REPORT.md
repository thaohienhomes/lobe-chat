# 🔍 Deployment Investigation Report: Missing Sepay & Pricing Features

**Date:** October 28, 2025\
**Status:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDING IDENTIFIED**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Your Sepay payment integration and pricing model changes **ARE NOT DEPLOYED** to production because they are on a **feature branch**, not on the `main` branch. Production deployments only occur when code is pushed to `main`.

---

## 🎯 Root Cause: Feature Branch vs Main Branch

### Current Situation:

- **Your Feature Branch:** `thaohienhomes/fix/subscription-checkout-prerender`
- **Latest Commit on Feature Branch:** `2287f26f7` (just pushed)
- **Commits with Sepay/Pricing Changes:** 10 new commits (from `29645aa7c` to `2287f26f7`)
- **Production Deployment:** Still on `29cce76` from September 11 (47 days old)

### Why Features Aren't Live:

```
Feature Branch (thaohienhomes/fix/subscription-checkout-prerender)
├── 2287f26f7 ✅ chore: update gitignore
├── 2855a5d6a ✅ feat: update UI and layout components
├── 5ac752296 ✅ feat: update configuration and environment
├── 45a79b10c ✅ refactor: improve infrastructure services
├── cf9449dac ✅ feat: update subscription and pricing system ← PRICING CHANGES
├── 6faa12ae9 ✅ feat: enhance payment system (Sepay and Polar) ← SEPAY CHANGES
├── c720a2c35 ✅ feat: enhance authentication and security
├── 999dabd2c ✅ feat: add AgentRouter AI model provider support
├── c4af8f71e ✅ refactor: centralize branding configuration
└── be10bc7ec ✅ feat: add masked card field to billing schema

Main Branch (production)
└── 29cce76 ❌ tests+ui: PayOS webhook idempotency/status tests (Sept 11)
```

**The `deploy-prod.yml` workflow ONLY triggers on pushes to `main` branch.**

## 🔴 Disabled GitHub Workflows Analysis

### Workflows Currently Disabled:

1. **`sync.yml` (Upstream Sync)** - ❌ NOT critical for deployment
   - Purpose: Syncs upstream LobeChat changes
   - Impact: None on your production deployments
   - Status: Safe to leave disabled

2. **`issue-close-require.yml` (Issue Close Require)** - ❌ NOT critical for deployment
   - Purpose: Auto-closes inactive GitHub issues
   - Impact: None on your production deployments
   - Status: Safe to leave disabled

3. **`lighthouse.yml` (Lighthouse Badger)** - ❌ NOT critical for deployment
   - Purpose: Performance monitoring/badges
   - Impact: None on your production deployments
   - Status: Safe to leave disabled

4. **`auto-i18n.yml` (Daily i18n Update)** - ❌ NOT critical for deployment
   - Purpose: Automatic internationalization updates
   - Impact: None on your production deployments
   - Status: Safe to leave disabled

### Conclusion:

**None of the disabled workflows are preventing your features from deploying.** The issue is purely that your code is on a feature branch, not on `main`.

## ✅ Solution: Deploy Your Changes to Production

### Step 1: Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Your feature branch is ready to merge
# Go to GitHub and create a PR from:
# thaohienhomes/fix/subscription-checkout-prerender → main
```

### Step 2: Review & Merge

1. Go to <https://github.com/thaohienhomes/lobe-chat/pulls>
2. Create new PR from your feature branch to `main`
3. Review the 10 commits and 34 file changes
4. Merge to `main` branch

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment

Once merged to `main`:

- GitHub Actions `deploy-prod.yml` will automatically trigger
- Your Sepay and pricing changes will deploy to production
- Changes will be live on pho.chat within 5-10 minutes
